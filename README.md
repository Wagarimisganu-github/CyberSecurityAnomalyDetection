# Cyber Security Anomaly Detection System Data Mining and Machine Learning Course

A real-time anomaly detection system designed to identify cybersecurity threats in network traffic using a layered machine learning.

about Project
This implements a multi-stage anomaly detection system to monitor network data for potential threats. It combines unsupervised learning techniques to detect anomalies and assess their severity, making it suitable for real-time cybersecurity applications.

### Features
- **Input Options**: use cybersecurityanomalydetection dataset.

  1. **Isolation Forest**: Initial anomaly detection on full dataset.
  2. **One-Class SVM**: Refines anomalies from Isolation Forest.
  3. **Autoencoder**: Final severity scoring (Low/Medium/High) using a Deep Neural Network.
